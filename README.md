# JungTribute
A single web tribute page dedicated to Dr. Carl Justav Jung. 

This single web page is meant to demonstrate an extremely basic framework for a script-lite web page with minimal styling.
It exists more as a front-end basis for beautification of listed bibliographic content. 
Future efforts will be directed towards allowing the import of CSV works cited pages to populate the core area. 
The benefit to this iteration is that individual authors will have organized references, increasing accessibility to their content.
